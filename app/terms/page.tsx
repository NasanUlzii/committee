        THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS constitute a binding legal agreement between
        you (“Customer,” “Care Recipient,” “Family” “you,” or “your”) and Elder
        Technologies Limited (“Elder,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a company
        registered in England and Wales. The Terms govern your use of our
        software applications, websites, and services that facilitate the
        connection between Care Recipients and Self Employed Carers for the
        provision of in-home personal and unregulated care services
        (collectively, the “Elder Services”). By using or accessing the Elder
        Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with
        these Terms, you may not use the Elder Services. Elder may revise these
        terms of use at any time by updating this posting. You should check the
        Website from time to time to review the current terms of use because the
        up to date terms of use are the ones that will be binding on you 1.
        Nature of the Service 1.1 Elder is an online marketplace platform and
        mobile application that connect persons (Customers/Family) who are
        looking to engage self employed carers , to provide in-home personal
        care, and self employed carers (Carers) who are part of Elder’s network
        who want to provide personal care services. 1.2 Elder is an Introductory
        Agency. Elder provides an online marketplace to facilitate the process
        of finding and hiring self employed carers, to provide a secure means
        for handling payments and markets and introduces carers to customers.
        Elder is not permitted to make changes to a Care Recipient’s care plan,
        provide rotas or effect direction and control over the delivery of care.
        For the avoidance of doubt this is always the responsibility of You. 1.3
        Elder operates as an Employment Agency in accordance with the Conduct of
        Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 (the
        “Conduct Regulations”). We introduce and match self-employed carers to
        customers based on the care needs provided by You, with a view to the
        Carer providing care services directly to You on a self-employed basis.
        For the avoidance of doubt, Elder: (i) Does not employ Carers; (ii) Does
        not provide employment services in the sense of hiring or managing
        Carers as employees; (iii) Does not recommend or guarantee the
        suitability of Carers, beyond making introductions based on the
        information provided; (iv) Does not find employment for Carers, but
        facilitates introductions for the purpose of enabling Customers to
        contract directly with self-employed Carers. All Carers introduced by
        Elder operate under a self-employed arrangement and enter into a direct
        contract with the Customer for the provision of care services. 1.4
        Carers on Elder’s platform do not carry out regulated or nursing care,
        they only carry out tasks related to personal care. In the context of
        the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations
        2014, personal care is defined as the physical assistance or prompting
        and supervision related to specific daily living activities for
        individuals who are unable to perform them independently. 1.5
        Registering and creating an account with Elder is free. There is no
        charge for a family to post care vacancies or to review content, or for
        Carers to review posted care vacancies. 1.6 Elder may use third party
        providers to: (a) cross-check the validity of the identity information
        supplied by the Carer against multiple public and privately-held data
        sources; (b) perform a non-exhaustive background check of the
        information supplied by the Carer against multiple public and
        privately-held data sources. 1.7 The Platform connects Customers with
        Carers. When a vacancy is booked, a binding agreement is created between
        the You and the Carer. Elder is not a party to that agreement. Elder
        does not and cannot control either the Customer or the Carer, the
        services provided (or not provided) or the quality or timing of those
        services and disclaims all liability for such. 1.8 At its absolute
        discretion, Elder may refuse to allow any person to register or create
        an account with Elder or cancel or suspend any existing account if it
        reasonably forms the view that the User’s conduct or presence on the
        Elder Platform, including a breach of User Obligations, is detrimental
        to the operation of the Elder Platform and/or the security, welfare or
        experience of other users. Elder may monitor communication made on the
        Platform between users for this purpose – see our Privacy and Cookie
        Policy. 1.9 We operate what we call a ‘self-managed model of care’ via
        Elder Technologies Ltd. During any placement, the Self Employed Carer
        works directly for You. 1.10 Elder is able to facilitate an introduction
        to Carer’s providing the following: 1.10.1 Live in Care – Live within
        your home for the duration of the Placement 1.10.2 Visiting Care – Visit
        your home from as little as 1 hour per week 2. Elder obligations 2.1
        Elder shall (subject to availability) provide systems: Which may
        facilitate the Introduction of a Self Employed Carer via matching
        services; Via which Customers can connect and communicate with Carers.
        2.1.1 Elder shall not be responsible for reviewing or policing Customer
        and Carer’s content/communications and so it is possible that the
        communication platform may contain offensive, harmful, inaccurate or
        otherwise inappropriate material. 2.1.2 The Communication Platform is
        intended to allow Customers and Carer to send and receive messages and
        material that are legal, proper and related to the Communications
        Platform. The Customer therefore warrants: that it will exercise proper
        judgment when using the Communication Platform; it shall only send and
        receive messages and material that are legal, proper and related to the
        care of the Care Recipient. 2.1.3 Elder does not guarantee the
        truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted in
        the Communications Platform or endorse any opinions expressed in the
        Communications Platform. Customers should take all due care in relying
        on material posted in the Communications Platform, as this is done at
        the Customer’s own risk. 2.2 Platform availability – Elder endeavors to
        ensure the Platform is normally available 24 hours a day, Elder shall
        not be liable if for any reason the Website is unavailable or for any
        period. Access to the Website may be suspended temporarily and without
        notice in the case of system failure, maintenance or repair or for
        reasons beyond Elder’s control. 2.3 Background checks. Elder checks the
        backgrounds of each Self Employed Carer via third party background check
        Services; however, Elder does not guarantee or warrant, and makes no
        representations regarding, the reliability, quality or suitability of
        such Carers. It is the sole responsibility of each Carer and not Elder,
        to determine whether they are qualified and capable of completing a
        particular Placement. The final responsibility for any decision to
        engage a Carer rests with the Customer, who is therefore strongly
        advised to check details, documentation (including right to work
        documentation) and references personally. If, within a period of three
        months from the date of introduction of a Carer to a Customer, Elder
        receives or obtains information that gives reasonable grounds to believe
        the Carer is or may be unsuitable for the Placement in which they have
        been engaged, Elder shall inform the Customer of that information
        without delay and in any event on the same day or, where that is not
        reasonably practicable, on the next working day. 2.4
        Emergency/Safeguarding. Elder operates with a firm commitment to
        safeguarding adults at risk, in line with our obligations under UK law.
        We believe every adult has the right to live safely, free from abuse and
        neglect. To uphold this principle, Elder has appointed a Designated
        Safeguarding Lead and maintains robust safeguarding protocols. All
        parties agree that where there is a concern regarding the safety or
        well-being of a Care Recipient, the following actions must be taken: (i)
        Immediate Risk: If a Care Recipient is in imminent danger, emergency
        services must be contacted immediately by dialling 999. (ii)
        Safeguarding Concerns: Any concerns relating to abuse, neglect, or harm
        should be reported to the relevant local authority. You can identify the
        appropriate local authority using the “Find Your Local Council” service
        via postcode. (iii) Criminal Conduct: Suspected criminal activity (e.g.,
        theft, assault, or serious neglect) must be reported to the police. Call
        999 in emergencies or 101 for non-urgent matters. In addition, any
        safeguarding concerns should be reported directly to Elder by emailing
        safeguarding@elder.org. Emails are monitored Monday to Friday during
        business hours. Self-employed carers may also raise concerns via the
        CareLogs section on the Elder Hub. All reports are reviewed by Elder’s
        Designated Safeguarding Lead, who will take appropriate action and
        liaise with external authorities where necessary. Serious concerns are
        typically reviewed within 3 business hours. Where concerns relate to the
        conduct of a self-employed carer, Elder will follow its safeguarding and
        quality assurance procedures. All safeguarding matters are overseen by
        Elder’s Integrated Governance Committee, which includes senior
        leadership and operational roles, and meets weekly to review and address
        active safeguarding cases. 3. Customer obligations 3.1. It is the sole
        responsibility of each Customer to ensure that they are satisfied with
        the suitability, qualifications and capability of each Self Employed
        Carer for their placement, including checking any Carer’s Right to Work
        documentation which will be made available to You on request by Elder.
        When You book a Placement or deal with a Carer, You should ensure that
        You agree to use common sense and caution to ensure protection of
        personal property and safety, including by supervising Carers as You
        would supervise anyone who provided a service to You that You did not
        know. 3.2 When creating and editing their profile, Carers are able to
        credit themselves as being DBS certified. In order to ensure the safety
        of our customers, carers on the Elder platform are required to have an
        enhanced DBS or PVG no older than 3 years and 10 months. Background
        checks form part of our application process, and carers cannot gain
        access to the Elder platform without one. We prompt self-employed carers
        to start the process of renewing their certificates from 24 months of
        issue. Once a certificate reaches 2 years and 10 months, they won’t be
        able to view nor apply for work opportunities, and will only regain
        access to placements once a renewed certificate is provided. For the
        avoidance of doubt we do not undertake verification of this
        certification nor ongoing monitoring to ensure its continued validity,
        unless where expressly stated as above. In all other instances, the onus
        for verifying the validity of this accreditation falls entirely on You.
        3.3 When creating their Elder profiles, Carers are required to submit
        two references onto the Elder platform as part of their sign-up process.
        Elder’s platform collects these references electronically and a
        referee’s submission is reviewed before a Carer’s account is activated
        on the platform. Elder does not speak in person to the individual
        referees. The onus for verifying the validity of a Carer’s specific
        reference – be it the one provided as part of their sign-up process, or
        any other reference they provide the parent with – falls entirely on
        You. 3.4 Clauses above explain the extent of the checks that we make in
        relation to Carers and Customers. We do not carry out further
        verification of Carers, Care Recipients or their profiles. You should
        make your own assessment of the people you decide to interact with
        through the Website, whether you are a Customer or a Carer You must rely
        on your own judgement and common sense. The checks that we have carried
        out and made available through the Website are only part of this
        process. Elder accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or
        completeness of any profile on the Website as we do not check them. We
        do not accept responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of
        the checks made in clauses above, nor the validity of Carer profile
        information outlined in these clauses to the extent that we have been
        deliberately misled by the individual in question, and/or to the extent
        that the source of 3rd party information used was inaccurate. 3.5
        LIVE-IN CARE Live-in Self Employed Carers have various rights pursuant
        to the law, and You hereby agree to provide each Self Employed Carer :
        3.5.1: a minimum break of 2 hours per day within daylight hours with the
        ability to leave the property and be undisturbed. At the request of the
        Self Employed Carer, it is permissible for these breaks to be banked to
        provide a longer individual break but the minimum duration is 14 hours
        over 7 days; and 3.5.2: sanitary living conditions must include (i) a
        private bedroom and suitable bathing and toilet facilities; (ii) basic
        appliances in good working order (iii) clean bedding and (iv) provision
        of ample food. In respect of (iv), we recommend a minimum sum of £40 per
        week for the cost of the Self Employed Carer’s food. 3.6 VISITING CARE
        Visiting Self Employed Carers: You and each Visiting Self Employed Carer
        will be responsible for agreeing hours and duties directly on any
        placement, and Visiting Self Carers may not be entitled to a break 3.7
        You will carry out risk assessments of the services to be undertaken and
        notify the Self Employed Carer immediately of any specific or potential
        hazards relating to the engagement and any precautions the carer should
        take in relation to such risks; 3.8 You will not allow the Self Employed
        Carer to undertake any work that is hazardous without first undertaking
        a risk assessment and notifying the Self Employed Carer of any risks
        identified; 3.9 You will if applicable, make clear to the Self Employed
        Carer what rules (including but not limited to health and safety, site
        and security policies, procedures and regulations) apply in respect of
        the location; 3.10 You will ensure that any and all equipment, and
        protective clothing are in good order and are suitable, safe and comply
        with all relevant health & safety legislation;. 3.11 There are certain
        tasks your Self Employed Carer cannot carry out. You agree and
        acknowledge that you will not direct the Self-Employed Carer to
        undertake tasks and activities which are prohibited when engaging a
        Carer on the Elder platform. Specialist care tasks that fall outside of
        the services of the platform include: STOMA care Catheterisation PEG
        care Wound Care Ventilation, Oxygen Support, BiPAP or CPAP Support
        Unstable Epilepsy Controlled Drug Administration Covert Medication
        Administration Glucose readings via finger pricks Injections Pessaries,
        Enemas, Suppositories Active addiction interventions Acute mental health
        disorders Any actions which could be considered a deprivation of liberty
        (e.g. locking doors to prevent someone from leaving their home) 3.12 You
        acknowledge and agree that you have read, understood, and will comply
        with the guidance set out in Schedule 1 to these Terms and Conditions.
        The provisions of Schedule 1 form an integral and enforceable part of
        this agreement and shall have full contractual effect as if expressly
        incorporated in the body of these Terms. 4. Insurance 4.1 It is for You
        to ensure that Your household and motor insurance provide sufficient
        cover for You and the self-employed carer during any Placement. 4.2 It
        is for You to ensure that any self-employed carer attending the
        Placement has the correct and any additional insurance as required by
        You. 4.3 Elder has a £5,000,000 public liability policy with Camberford
        Law PLC (the “Policy”). The Policy covers each self-employed carer only
        for any accidental damage which may occur when they are in Your
        property. The Policy includes a £500 excess in relation to any claim for
        accidental damage to property and this will be for You to pay, if any
        claim is made. 5. Fees 5.1 You agree to pay Elder the total Placement
        Fee (inclusive of VAT, where applicable) for each booking made with a
        Carer through the Elder platform. 5.2 The Placement Fee is made up of
        two components: The Service Fee: This is the amount payable directly to
        the self-employed Carer for the delivery of care services. The Service
        Fee reflects the maximum agreed rate accepted by the Carer for the
        specific placement. The Elder Booking Fee: This is the fee retained by
        Elder for facilitating the placement and providing platform services. It
        covers, but is not limited to: (i) Conducting safety, identity,
        compliance and background checks on Carers; maintaining platform safety,
        safeguarding processes, and data protection standards; (ii) Providing
        and maintaining the technology platform, including access to matching
        tools, the booking system, and customer support services. Elder
        determines the Booking Fee at its sole discretion and may revise it from
        time to time. The applicable Booking Fee will always be reflected in the
        total Placement Fee displayed at the point of booking. 5.3 All Placement
        Fees are collected by Elder on behalf of both parties via a third party
        payment provider. Upon receipt of payment, the Service Fee is
        distributed to the self-employed Carer and Elder retains the Booking
        Fee. You acknowledge that Elder acts as an agent for the Carer in
        collecting the Service Fee. 5.4 Placement Fees are non-refundable unless
        You cancel the booking with a minimum of 48 hours’ notice prior to the
        scheduled start time. Any cancellations made within 48 hours of the
        scheduled start time will remain chargeable in full. 5.5 You are liable
        for any and all taxes (other than taxes based on Elder’s income) related
        to the Placement performed by Self Employed Carers, apart from Self
        Employed Carer’s own income tax accountability which is met directly by
        each Self Employed Carer. 5.6 Elder will charge You for placements
        through the payment method specified in Your account (e.g. a credit card
        or debit card). If You pay any applicable Fees with a credit card, Elder
        may seek pre-authorisation of Your credit card account prior to the
        Placement starting to verify that the credit card is valid and has the
        necessary funds or credit available to cover Your requested Placement.
        5.7 You agree to Elder authorising any designated credit card, or debit
        card or other payment method or account to pay any Fees described
        herein, and authorise Elder to charge all sums due at any time to that
        designated account. You agree to provide Elder as soon as possible with
        updated information regarding Your designated credit card and account or
        upon Elder’s request and any time the information earlier provided is no
        longer valid. 5.8 You are responsible for ensuring all billing and
        contact details are up to date to ensure invoices sent by Elder are
        accurate, and payments received by Elder are on time, with no delay. 5.9
        Elder reserves the right to charge You an additional administration fee
        of £25 if the payment details You have provided become out of date, and
        You have not provided Elder with new payment details within 5 working
        days, or immediately upon request by Elder. 5.10 You agree to pay all
        invoices issued by Elder within seven (7) days of receipt. If payment is
        not received by the due date, Elder reserves the right to charge
        interest on the overdue amount at a rate of 4% per annum above the Bank
        of England base rate, calculated daily from the due date until the date
        of actual payment, whether before or after judgment. Elder may also
        recover reasonable costs incurred in recovering any overdue sums. 5.11
        Where, at the Customer’s instruction, Elder agrees to accept payment
        from a third party (including, but not limited to, a local authority or
        other funding body) in respect of part of the Placement Rate or
        associated fees, this shall not affect the Customer’s overall liability
        for the full amount payable under this Agreement. Such arrangements are
        typically made where the Customer has secured external funding but do
        not create a contractual relationship between Elder and the third party.
        The contract for services and all associated payment obligations remain
        solely between Elder and the Customer. Accordingly, the Customer shall
        remain liable for the full payment of all amounts due, regardless of
        whether any third party fails or delays in making their agreed
        contribution. It is the Customer’s responsibility to make arrangements
        with, and seek reimbursement from, any such third party. Elder shall not
        be responsible for pursuing or recovering any unpaid contributions from
        third parties on the Customer’s behalf. 5.12 For the purposes of these
        Terms, an “Introduction” includes any situation where a Self-Employed
        Carer is placed with You or the Care Recipient by Elder, or where Elder
        has otherwise provided You with the Carer’s identity or details in
        relation to a potential Placement. You agree not to engage, contract
        with, or otherwise make use of the services of any Self-Employed Carer
        who has been Introduced to You by Elder, other than through the Elder
        platform, for a period of six (6) months from the later of (a) the end
        of the most recent Placement of that Carer with You or the Care
        Recipient arranged through Elder, or (b) the date of Introduction where
        no Placement has taken place. If You do engage a Self-Employed Carer in
        breach of this clause, Elder reserves the right to charge You a fee
        equivalent to the total fees that would have been payable for six (6)
        months of care provided by that Carer through the Elder platform. This
        fee will become due and payable immediately upon receipt of invoice. 6.
        Termination TERMINATION BY ELDER 6.1 If You violate any of the Agreement
        Terms, Your permission to use the Services will automatically terminate
        with immediate effect. 6.2 You also agree that Elder may, at any time
        and without notice to You, suspend or revoke Your access to and use of
        the Services, and any account(s) You may have in connection with the
        Services: (i) for any reason or no reason at all; (ii) where Elder
        determines at our sole discretion that such action is reasonable in
        order to comply with legal requirements or to protect the rights or
        interests of the Elder or any third party; or (iii) in connection with
        any general discontinuation of the Services. We also reserve the right
        to modify the Services at any time without notice to You. 6.3 Please
        note, that whilst the matter remains at Elder’s sole discretion, Elder
        is likely to terminate this Agreement, and reserves its rights to do so,
        if You fail or delay to make payments of 4 invoices in succession; fail
        or delay to make payment for a period of 4 weeks or more; or over a
        period of 6 months prior to termination, the account held by You has
        fallen into arrears on more than 2 occasions. 6.4 Notification will be
        made by Notice by Elder to You at the email address provided by You
        and/or by letter by Royal Mail 6.5 Elder will have no liability
        whatsoever as a result of any change to the Services or any suspension
        or revocation of Your access to or use of the Services. TERMINATION BY
        YOU 6.6 You may terminate this Agreement, and Your account with Elder,
        at any time by contacting customer Services at support@elder.org,
        providing Elder with a minimum of 14 days’ notice of Your intention to
        do so. Any termination made by You without providing the minimum notice,
        may incur a financial penalty over any costs incurred by Self Employed
        Carer in the Placement, and You will be liable for all sums due up to
        and including the date of termination. 6.7 If You choose to cancel the
        Services, You are still liable to Elder for payment of all Services
        undertaken or due to be undertaken by Elder or the Self Employed Carer
        on Your behalf. 6.8 Elder reserves the right to charge You (at its sole
        discretion) in full for all and any part of the Services undertaken on
        Your behalf for the whole of the Notice Period. Such Notice Period
        charges will be added to Your final invoice, and will be due and payable
        by You in full within 7 days after the last day of the Notice period, or
        within 14 days of the last day of the provision of the Services,
        whichever is sooner. 6.9 If You choose to engage any Self Employed Carer
        directly (in contravention of the Terms of this Agreement) You become
        immediately liable to Elder for the Fees equal to six (6) months’ Fees
        for the Self Employed Carer’s Placement with You or any other Customer
        or Care Recipient. 7. Indemnity You agree that You will be personally
        responsible for Your use of the Services, and You agree to defend,
        indemnify and hold harmless Elder and its officers, directors,
        employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from and
        against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses,
        including reasonable solicitors’ and accounting fees and costs, arising
        out of the use of the Services by You, the Care Recipient, or anyone on
        Your or their behalf. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to
        assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject
        to indemnification by You, and in such case, You agree to cooperate with
        our defence of such claim. You will not, in any event, settle any claim,
        prospective, litigated, or other related matter without our written
        consent 8. Use of the Services Is Entirely At Your Risk 8.1 You
        expressly understand and agree that Your use of the Services is at Your
        sole risk and that the Services is provided “as is” and “as available”.
        Elder expressly excludes all warranties and conditions, (whether implied
        by statute, common law or otherwise and including any warranty as to
        fitness for purpose and satisfactory quality, and non-infringement) to
        the maximum extent permitted by law. 8.2 When You use the Services to
        request and have an self-employed carer perform a Placement, You
        understand and acknowledge that no self-employed carer has any authority
        to make any amendments to this Agreement and that any statements,
        representations, or warranties made by a self-employed carer or any
        third party are disclaimed by Elder and do not expand or otherwise
        modify this Agreement. Elder makes no representation or warranty
        regarding the identity, quality, reliability, safety, completeness, or
        fitness of self-employed carer. 8.3 Once any Placement starts, the
        self-employed carer engaged in that Placement works directly for, and
        under the direction of, You. 9. Limitation of Liability and Release 9.1
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, Elder will not be liable to
        You in connection with Elder’s performance under this Agreement,
        including (but not limited to) liability for loss of profits and other
        consequential losses. 9.2 Elder’s liability to You in respect of the
        Services or any Placement will not exceed the total price paid by You
        for the Placement, whether such cause of action is brought in contract,
        tort, warranty or otherwise. 9.3 Except in the case of death or personal
        injury caused by Elder’s negligence, Elder’s liability under or in
        connection with this Agreement whether arising in contract, tort,
        negligence, breach of statutory duty or otherwise howsoever shall not
        exceed the level of any Fees paid by You to the Company in the last six
        months under these Terms and Conditions. 9.4 Neither Party shall be
        liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence, breach of
        statutory duty nor otherwise for any loss, damage, costs or expenses of
        any nature whatsoever incurred or suffered by that other Party of an
        indirect or consequential nature including without limitation any
        economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business or goodwill.
        9.5 The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements
        of the basis of the bargain between Elder and You. 9.6 Nothing in this
        Agreement shall limit any rights You might have as a consumer or other
        statutory rights that may not be excluded by law, nor exclude or limit
        our liability to You for any death or personal injury resulting from our
        negligence. 10. General Prohibitions You agree not to do or attempt (or

        Schedule 1 – Carer Guidance Additionally, you agree that you acknowledge
        the following advice and guidance: 3.11.1 On mobility If the Care
        Recipient falls, the carer should avoid lifting them to prevent
        potential harm to both the Care Recipient and the carer. Seeking advice
        and support by contacting 111 is recommended. 3.11.2 On catheterisation
        Carers should be thought of as an extension of a family member. A
        carer’s primary role is to provide ‘personal care’ and that this is
        fundamentally different from nursing care. Tasks such as catheterisation
        would fall outside of what any carer – regulated or introductory – would
        be able to provide and would instead be provided by a District Nurse as
        part of a local primary care package. Please be advised that carers
        should do no more than empty a leg bag and attach a night bag to a leg
        bag. District Nurses should attend to change the leg bag weekly as this
        must be done using an aseptic non-touch technique to reduce the risk of
        infection. District Nurses should be available to support if any
        complications occur. Please share with your carer their contact details.
        3.11.3 On skin integrity and wound care support Wound dressings and
        managing long term open wounds require specialist medical training and
        would typically fall to a District Nurse team working within the
        guidance of a local GP surgery. Carers may be able to support with
        grazes and abrasions which would need temporary coverings for comfort
        but they are not nurses. Carers can support as part of a package of care
        that includes a district nursing team but they cannot be a replacement
        for a district nurse where that care is needed. 3.11.4 On medication
        Carers should be thought of as an extension of a family member. A carer
        can support a care recipient to self administer medication by prompting,
        reminding and helping remove medicines from packaging. Carers can also
        administer medication as this is permitted within their personal care
        role where no nursing care is provided. As Elder are unable to direct,
        monitor or manage medication administration you should consult the
        prescriber to ensure they are satisfied that the medication will be
        administered correctly by a carer, just as you would do if you yourself
        were going to be taking on this role. Please note that self-employed
        carers sourced via the Elder Platform are prohibited from administering:
        Controlled drugs Injections Suppositories Pessaries Enemas Please also
        be advised that there are higher risks associated with a self employed
        carer administering liquid medication, patches, eye drops, topical
        treatments, inhalers and sprays. 3.11.4 On nail care Please be advised
        that carers should not cut nails due to high risk of harm and infection.
        A chiropodist should be arranged for toenail care beyond filing. 3.11.6
        People who menstruate and need support with intimate hygiene Intimate
        personal care is hands-on physical care in personal hygiene. When
        undertaking intimate personal care tasks for people that menstruate or
        handling soiled material where hands or clothing could be contaminated
        by a body product, carers must wear appropriate PPE to include a
        disposable plastic apron and appropriate gloves. All waste contaminated
        by body products must be disposed of promptly. Self-employed carers are
        not to insert contraceptive devices, tampons, or menstrual cups due to
        the invasive nature of this procedure. 3.11.7 No Specialist Care
        Provision: As a Self-Employed Carer on the Elder platform you will not
        be expected to undertake any duties which are nurse-led, require
        specialist training, or any for which you feel you can not undertake
        safely. 3.12 When you register with us and choose a password to protect
        your secure account, you are responsible for maintaining the
        confidentiality of your password. If you become aware of any
        unauthorised use of your account, you must notify us and you should
        change your password immediately. You are solely responsible for all
        activities that occur under your password and/or account. You shall not
        permit anyone else to use your account.
