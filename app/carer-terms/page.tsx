        agree to be bound by this Agreement and any Elder Terms and Conditions
        of Service (the “Terms” or “Terms and Conditions of Service”) as updated
        from time to time on Elder’s website or other platforms, which govern
        your use of the Service; you may use the App and the Service only as set
        forth in this Agreement; and acknowledge that you have read and
        understood the content of our privacy policy (available at
        https://www.elder.org/carer-privacy/), as updated from time to time. 1.
        GENERAL PROVISIONS 1.1 Background Statement For the purposes of the
        Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and
        Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 (as amended), Elder operates as
        an employment agency. Elder introduces self-employed carers to clients
        seeking care services but does not employ carers, nor does it supervise
        or direct the manner in which care services are delivered. You
        acknowledge that you are engaged on a self-employed basis and are
        responsible for your own tax, insurance, and compliance obligations. By
        confirming your acceptance of this Agreement, Elder and Self Employed
        Carer agree that Self Employed Carer will provide these Services to any
        Customer strictly as a Self Employed Carer, and in no other capacity.
        Once the Customer has engaged a Self Employed Carer to provide the
        Placement, that Self Employed Carer is directly engaged by and working
        for the Customer in a self-employed capacity. The Self Employed Carer
        does not work for or on behalf of Elder. Elder does not provide the
        Placement described in this Agreement and does not employ individuals to
        undertake the Placement. Elder’s role is the provision of the technology
        platform as a referral tool for Customers and Self Employed Carers, to
        undertake Self Employed Carer onboarding processes, and to facilitate
        payments from Customers to Self Employed Carers. 1.2 Requirements of
        Self Employed Carer Access to the Elder Platform and Terms of Use Before
        receiving access to the Elder Platform, the Self Employed Carer must
        also review and agree to the Terms of Use of the Elder Platform which
        form part of this Agreement, and which the Self Employed Carer agrees
        and accepts. To the extent the Terms of Use of the Elder Platform are
        inconsistent with this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall be
        preferred. From time to time, in their sole and complete discretion,
        Customers will post Placements through the Elder Platform, setting forth
        the nature of the Placement required by the Customer. Placements posted
        will be offered to the Self Employed Carers on the Site. Subject only to
        the limitation contained in paragraph 9.1 of this Agreement, the Self
        Employed Carer is not obliged to review the Placements posted or select
        any Placements by any Customer at any time. Once a Self Employed Carer’s
        application to a Placement is successful, the Elder Platform will
        confirm the Placement has been booked by the Self Employed Carer and
        confirmed by the Customer. 1.3 Contract for Placement Once a Placement
        is booked, and the Self Employed Carer provides to the satisfaction of
        Elder a copy of their DBS, PVG or other similar documentation, and any
        other information or documentation requested by the Customer or by Elder
        on behalf of the Customer a contract is formed directly between the
        Customer and You, the Self Employed Carer, for You to complete the
        Placement. At the stage that that contract is formed, You are working
        directly for the Customer. By confirming your acceptance of this
        Agreement, You hereby appoint Elder to be your agent solely for the
        purposes of entering into such a contract with the Customer on your
        behalf. You, the Self Employed Carer, agrees that Your name and phone
        number and any relevant documentation or information may be provided or
        made available to Customer by Elder (or to any associated entity on
        Customer’s or Elder’s behalf) after the Placement is booked. Once a
        Placement is confirmed, You, the Self Employed Carer agrees that Elder
        can share their contact details and other relevant documentation or
        information with any relevant third parties. As required, You will also
        be provided with the contact number for any current or proximate Self
        Employed Carers at the Placement and vice versa. 1.4 Non-Exclusive Usage
        Elder recognises that the Self Employed Carer is working in a
        self-employed capacity, and is free to carry out their own business
        during the currency of this Agreement. Subject to the Expected
        Behaviours set out in clause 2.1 below, the Self Employed Carer shall be
        under no obligation or expectation at any point to accept any Placement
        that is proposed or posted. 1.5 Restrictions on Engaging with Introduced
        Customers The Self Employed Carer recognises and agrees that by engaging
        with the Elder platform You will be introduced to Customers and Care
        Recipients and that there is a commercial value in the business
        relationships which Elder has or may have in relation to those Customers
        and Care Recipients, and that Elder has a legitimate business interest
        in protecting those business relationships. You agree that You will not
        engage in any way other than through Elder (whether directly or
        indirectly and whether on your own account or through a third party)
        with any Customer or Care Recipient whose details were provided or made
        available to You through the Elder platform, save only any Customers or
        Care Recipients with whom You can demonstrate at the time of first
        Placement (and as may be requested by Elder at any time) that You had a
        prior commercial relationship before any introduction was made by Elder.
        1.6 Feedback from Customers You agree that any Feedback received by
        Elder from Customers or Care Recipients regarding any Placement may be
        shared with any third party, or used in any marketing, advertising or
        other media, in anonymised form and without Self Employed Carer’s
        further additional consent. 2. THE PLACEMENT You shall be eligible to
        apply to Placements that You are qualified to provide through the Elder
        Platform. 2.1 Expected Standards of Behaviour You and Elder recognise
        that whilst Elder is introducing the Self Employed Carer to the
        Customer, the direct relationship is between the Self Employed Carer and
        the Customer, not the Self Employed Carer and Elder. The Self Employed
        Carer’s obligations to perform the Placement professionally, diligently
        and to a standard of care to be expected of a suitably qualified and
        competent Self Employed Carer are owed to the Customer and Care
        Recipient (and any of their designated associates) and are ultimately a
        matter between the Self Employed Carer and the Customer. You agree that
        Elder’s reputation may be damaged if You act inappropriately or to a
        poor standard during any Placement. You agree to be bound by Elder’s ESB
        at all times during Placements as may be updated or changed by Elder
        from time to time. If Elder is not satisfied that an Self Employed Carer
        is meeting any or all of the ESB, then Elder reserves the right not to
        offer that Self Employed Carer access to further Placements and/or to
        terminate this Agreement with the Self Employed Carer with immediate
        effect. The Self Employed Carer agrees not to accept any gifts, material
        or monetary, offered to them by the Customer (or associates), and that
        doing so will be considered an abuse of their position and a breach of
        the Expected Standards of Behaviour which may result in termination of
        this Agreement. The Self Employed Carer agrees not to use the Customer’s
        or Care Recipient’s address as the Self Employed Carer’s permanent
        address or residence, save with the Customer’s express permission in
        writing to do so, which permission must be set out in writing by the
        Customer, and sent directly to Elder at hello@elder.org 2.2 Placement
        Completion To ensure that the Elder Platform remains a reliable source
        of Placements and to ensure all Self Employed Carers are able to access
        available Placements, once an Self Employed Carer has been awarded a
        Placement, the Self Employed Carer is expected to complete that
        Placement within the timeframe specified by, and to the satisfaction of,
        the Customer. Any failure to do so without good reason would be seen as
        a significant breach of the ESB and may result in termination of this
        Agreement in accordance with clause 9. Once the Placement has started,
        You may not cancel the Placement without advance notice of at least
        fourteen (14) days to be provided to the Customer and Elder (“Notice
        Period”), except in the case of an unavoidable emergency, in which case,
        You shall notify Customer and Elder as soon as practicable. At Elder’s
        sole discretion, cancellation by the Self Employed Carer which is less
        than the Notice Period may also result in termination of this Agreement
        in accordance with clause 9. You, the Self Employed Carer understands
        and agrees that Your failure without good reason to complete a Placement
        in accordance with Customer’s specifications and satisfaction after You
        have applied for and been accepted on that Placement using the Elder
        Platform is a serious breach of the ESB likely to result in no further
        Placements being offered and/or the termination of this Agreement. In
        the event that You, the Self Employed Carer cancels the Placement either
        within or outside the Notice Period and the Customer declines any
        reschedule You may have proposed, Elder shall have the right to make the
        cancelled Placement available again on the Elder Platform. 2.3
        Termination of placement by Customer The Self Employed Carer recognises
        and acknowledges that any Placement may be cancelled by a Customer or
        Care Recipient at any time with immediate effect and without any Notice
        Period. If the Placement is cancelled in that manner, the Self Employed
        Carer will receive no payment after the date of cancellation. ESB
        includes that the Self Employed Carer should act professionally and
        appropriately in the event that such notice of termination is given. You
        agree to take all of your personal belongings with You when you leave
        the Placement property. In the event that the request to terminate is
        made through Elder, any notification by Elder to the Self Employed Carer
        that the placement is terminating shall be deemed to be notification
        given on behalf of the Customer. 2.4 Access to Elder Platform Elder
        reserves the right to deactivate the Self Employed Carer’s access to the
        Elder Platform at any time and for any reason. 2.5 No Control ESB by
        Self Employed Carers are expected by Elder at all times. Elder shall not
        otherwise control or have any right to control the manner or means by
        which You, the Self Employed Carer performs the Placement. You, the Self
        Employed Carer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
        Elder harmless for any claims, suits, or actions related to this
        provision, including any such claims brought by Self Employed Carer or
        by any third party with respect to any claims for taxes or
        contributions, including penalties and interest. 2.6 Suitability and
        Capability for Placements You, the Self Employed Carer acknowledges that
        multiple different types of Placements are offered through the Elder
        Platform. The Self Employed Carer acknowledges that Elder may at its
        sole discretion conduct a background check and interview the Self
        Employed Carer at the time of onboarding to ensure the Self Employed
        Carer is suitable and capable to complete Placements through the Elder
        Platform and also accepts and agrees to only accept and complete
        Placements in respect of which the Self Employed Carer has all relevant
        experience and any qualifications required in order to perform the
        Placement safely and as required. The Self Employed Carer hereby
        undertakes and agrees that the Self Employed Carer will exhibit all and
        any Right to Work, references, driving licences, passports, visas and
        other documents as required by Elder, and further warrants that all
        documents are valid, current and accurate at the time they are produced
        to Elder. 2.7A Live-in Care The Self Employed Carer may complete Live-in
        Care Placements through the Elder Platform. Live-in Care Placements
        necessitate moving into the home of the Care Recipient for a set period
        of time and then being on rotation with another Self Employed Carer. The
        Self Employed Carer will be provided with their own room within the Care
        Recipient’s house for the duration of the Placement Services as a
        Live-in Self Employed Carer. During a Live-in Care Placement, the Self
        Employed Carer is expected to be available on site in case of any and
        all urgent matters including emergencies. Self Employed Carers will not
        be expected to be working throughout the Placement, and Self Employed
        Carer will be able to enjoy their own leisure when not carrying out
        specific required tasks. It is expected that the Self Employed Carer
        will not ordinarily be called upon by the Care Recipient more than two
        times during the night, unless there were some pre-agreed care needs or
        unless there happened to be an emergency or unforeseen incident,
        requiring assistance from Self Employed Carer. The precise tasks to be
        carried out within a Placement should be agreed between the Self
        Employed Carer and the Care Recipient at the start of the Placement and
        evidenced in the Care Appraisal, and throughout the Placement as needs
        change. Elder encourages Self Employed Carers to develop a Care Plan
        with the Care Recipient and/or Customer. In general the typical tasks
        that may be required are care services, emergency care, assistance with
        cooking, cleaning or household chores, shopping, assisting the Care
        Recipient with travel to sites/events. Please see the attached
        (https://www.elder.org/documentation/carer-standards/) that sets out
        what tasks may typically be expected (although note that this is
        guidance only and it will depend on what the Self Employed Carer agrees
        with the Care Recipient). In the event that the Care Appraisal is not an
        accurate summary of the care needed by the Care Recipient on the
        Placement, the Self Employed Carer will contact the Customer in person
        or through the platform to ask that the Care Appraisal be updated. 2.7B
        Live-out Care/Visiting Care The Self Employed Carer may complete
        Live-out Care Placements through the Elder Platform. Live-out Care
        Placements do not require the Self Employed Carer to move into the home
        of the Care Recipient. The Self Employed Carer will complete Live-out
        Care Placements for a set period of time directly with and for the
        Customer and for the Care Recipient, for a number of designated hours
        per day (on an agreed basis directly with Customer) and by being on
        rotation with other Self Employed Carers. The precise tasks to be
        carried out within a Placement should be agreed between the Self
        Employed Carer and the Care Recipient at the start and throughout the
        Placement as care needs change. Elder encourages Self Employed Carers to
        liaise with Customers and Care Recipients to develop a Care Plan. Please
        see the attached guidance
        (https://www.elder.org/documentation/carer-standards/) that sets out
        what tasks may typically be expected (although note that this is
        guidance only and it will depend on what the Self Employed Carer agrees
        with the Customer and Care Recipient). In the event that the Care
        Appraisal is not an accurate summary of the care needed by the Care
        Recipient on the Placement, the Self Employed Carer will contact the
        Customer in person or through the platform to ask that the Care
        Appraisal be updated. 2.8 Daily Average Hours Attached guidance
        (https://www.elder.org/documentation/carer-standards/) sets out hourly
        average estimates for and Placement. By confirming your acceptance of
        this Agreement, You agree that this is a fair estimated average number
        of hours for any Placement you accept. If, having started a Placement,
        You think that the daily average is not appropriate for that Placement,
        You will let the Customer know as soon as possible, and let Elder know
        so that a review may be carried out by Elder with the Care Recipient.
        Any exceptions to this guidance estimate will be included in the Care
        Appraisal. Please note that any Placement Rate is based on a daily 24
        hour period worked by the Self Employed Carer in the Placement, and may
        include some night work. Self Employed Carer undertakes to confirm the
        extent of any night work with Customer and care Recipient before
        Placement starts, and to update the Customer and Care Appraisal with any
        changes to the night work requirement as needed. 2.9 Accommodation
        provided You understand that (if upon moving into the Care Recipient’s
        home for the purpose of Placement) You are not entitled through this
        Agreement to any property or possessions of the Customer or Care
        Recipient. Unless with the express written agreement from the Customer
        (which must be communicated by the Customer in writing to Elder) You
        undertake not to use the Placement address as your principal address or
        for any purpose other than the performance of the Placement. The Self
        Employed Carer accepts that any accommodation being provided is provided
        for the purposes of the Placement and that any right to stay in the
        accommodation is not a tenancy, and that right shall cease automatically
        when the Placement ceases. The accommodation will be a room within the
        Customer or Care Recipient’s home and the Self Employed Carer will not
        have the legal right to exclude permanently the Customer or Care
        Recipient from that room or hold exclusive possession of the room at
        law. 3. FEES 3.1 Fees The Customer shall pay for completed Placements
        through the Elder Platform at the rates quoted by Elder, which are
        determined based on the stated parameters of each Placement (the
        “Placement Rate”). Each Placement offered to a Self-Employed Carer on
        the Platform will include a “Service Fee”, which represents the maximum
        amount the Self-Employed Carer is entitled to receive weekly, in
        arrears, for the duration of the Placement. This rate is inclusive of
        any access to additional non-chargeable services offered by Elder
        (including participation in Elder’s Carer Loyalty Programme), all of
        which are funded by the Customer as part of the Placement Rate.
        Self-Employed Carers may agree to a lower Service Fee directly with the
        Customer, at their discretion. By accepting this Agreement, You
        acknowledge that the Booking Fee forms part of the overall Placement
        Rate payable by the Customer, and is retained by Elder in consideration
        for platform maintenance, customer support, trust and safety measures,
        and administrative support. For the avoidance of doubt, the Booking Fee
        is paid by the Customer and no charge is made to You for providing You
        with work-finding services or for any related services. 3.2 Service Fee
        Payment Elder collects the Placement Fee from the Customer via a third
        party payment provider. Elder distributes the Service Fee payment to You
        the Self Employed Carer. You must hold a direct deposit account in Your
        name, and provide those details to Elder, and keep Elder updated on any
        changes to any accounts held by You for this purpose. Elder shall use
        all reasonable endeavours to remit payment for each Placement, less
        Elder’s booking fee, distributing the Service Fee within ten (10)
        business days of receipt. 4. EQUIPMENT AND OPERATIONS 4.1 Compatible
        Mobile Device In order to apply to and attend Placements, Self Employed

        Customer (for which see paragraph 2.3 above). 9.3 Self Employed Carer’s
